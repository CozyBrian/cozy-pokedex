This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## My Process

I first read through the documentation of the pokemon api that was provides to understand the various routes and features I could utilize.

I then set up a basic nextjs application using the create next-app cli tool. then I installed the necessary dependencies, such as tailwind. etc

Since I'm using typescript, I needed to define all the types for the api requests. So I used a the documentation for that. and then coded the types accordingly

After running the app and verifying that everything works, I then started to focus on the styling.

I wanted to impliment the search functionality but there is not enough time... and I dont have enough time to figure out why the page refetches the api when I click the backbutton.

I'd to improve on the project by implimenting the search feature and fixing the back button bug... I feel its very inefficient to be making requests and starting from the beginning everytime you go back to the main page.
