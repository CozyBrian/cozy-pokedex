This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## My Process

I first read through the documentation of the pokemon api that was provides to understand the various routes and features I could utilize.

I then set up a basic nextjs application using the create next-app cli tool. then I installed the necessary dependencies, such as tailwind. etc
